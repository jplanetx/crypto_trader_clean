    "notes": "Ensure the updated client meets the new API specifications and integrates seamlessly with other system components. Completed WebsocketClient refactoring in src/core/websocket_client.py with separate initialization and subscription steps; authentication updated accordingly and unit tests have passed. Next thread (THREAD_012) initialized. Addressed pytest-asyncio warnings by using @pytest_asyncio.fixture. Added try...except block to handle KeyboardInterrupt exceptions in the _heartbeat_loop method in src/core/websocket_client.py. Corrected the test file to properly unpack the fixture. However, the tests are still being interrupted, and the same errors persist. It seems increasingly likely that the issue lies outside the code itself, possibly with the test environment or some external factor causing the KeyboardInterrupt.",

  "notes": "This thread ensures that the API credentials are valid before proceeding with dependency and implementation updates. The revised diagnostic report now clearly reflects that an error occurred. The authentication troubleshooter output indicated a 401 status with the message \"Invalid API Key\". This means that the API credentials are not validâ€”likely due to incorrect API key/secret, insufficient permissions, an out-of-sync system clock, an incorrect passphrase (if required), or rate limiting issues. The earlier report was incorrect, and the actual logs confirm a failure in authentication."

# WORKITEM-003: Order Execution System

**Status:** In Progress

## Completed:
- Created basic OrderExecutor class with methods for order validation, execution, tracking, and cancellation.
- Integrated support for live and paper trading modes.
- Basic risk management integration via config_manager.

## Next Steps:
1. Enhance error handling and logging:
   - Improve error context in retry logic.
   - Wrap exceptions with detailed messages for better troubleshooting.
2. Refine order lifecycle management:
   - Ensure proper state updates on order execution, cancellation, and position tracking.
   - Unify behavior between live and paper trading modes.
3. Develop comprehensive unit tests:
   - Test parameter validation (invalid order side, non-positive size/price).
   - Verify successful order execution and position updates.
   - Examine retry logic behavior on transient failures.
   - Validate risk manager integration.
   - Test order cancellation flows.
4. Run the verification script (scripts/verify_implementation.py) to confirm functionality and test coverage.
5. Update documentation as necessary.

## Work Items:
- [ ] Implement error handling and logging improvements in OrderExecutor.
- [ ] Add and refine unit tests for OrderExecutor.
- [ ] Verify enhancements using the verification script.
- [ ] Update risk management integration if needed.

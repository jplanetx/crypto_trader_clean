# Task Documentation

This directory contains detailed documentation for each work item in the project. Each task is documented in a separate file named `WORKITEM-XXX.md`, where XXX is the work item number.

## Structure

Each task document follows this structure:

```
# WORKITEM-XXX

## Task Details

Component: [Component Name]

## Implementation Notes

[Notes about the implementation approach, challenges, and solutions]

## Testing Steps

[Steps to test the implementation]

## Verification Results

[Results of verification tests]
```

## Process

1. When starting a new task, use the `start_task.py` script to create a new task document:
   ```
   python scripts/start_task.py XXX component_name
   ```

2. Update the task document with implementation notes and testing steps as you work.

3. When completing a task, use the `finish_task.py` script to update the verification results:
   ```
   python scripts/finish_task.py XXX component_name
   ```

## Purpose

These task documents serve as a persistent record of work done on the project. They provide:

- Context for future developers
- Documentation of implementation decisions
- Evidence of testing and verification
- A history of the project's development

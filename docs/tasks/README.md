# Task Documents

This directory contains detailed documents for each work item. When starting work on a new task, create a document here with the naming convention `WORKITEM-XXX.md`.

Each task document should include:

1. Detailed description of the task
2. Implementation approach
3. Testing strategy
4. Notes on any decisions made during implementation
5. Verification results

Use the task documents to track your progress and document your thought process as you implement each work item.

## Structure

Each task document follows this structure:

```
# WORKITEM-XXX

## Task Details

Component: [Component Name]

## Implementation Notes

[Notes about the implementation approach, challenges, and solutions]

## Testing Steps

[Steps to test the implementation]

## Verification Results

[Results of verification tests]
```

## Process

1. When starting a new task, use the `start_task.py` script to create a new task document:
   ```
   python scripts/start_task.py XXX component_name
   ```

2. Update the task document with implementation notes and testing steps as you work.

3. When completing a task, use the `finish_task.py` script to update the verification results:
   ```
   python scripts/finish_task.py XXX component_name
   ```

## Purpose

These task documents serve as a persistent record of work done on the project. They provide:

- Context for future developers
- Documentation of implementation decisions
- Evidence of testing and verification
- A history of the project's development

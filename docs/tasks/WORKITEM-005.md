# WORKITEM-005: Module Restructure for Integration Compatibility

**Status:** Proposed

## Description:
Following issues encountered during the full verification run, several components are not loading correctly due to import issues. The verification script indicates failures in the following modules:
- config_manager
- coinbase_client
- coinbase_streaming
- trading_core
- order_executor

These errors suggest that the projectâ€™s module structure does not match the expectations of the verification tool. The necessary improvements include reorganizing the files into package directories with appropriate __init__.py files and/or updating import paths accordingly.

## Tasks:
- [ ] Reorganize src/core modules:
  - Create a directory for each component (e.g., src/core/order_executor/) and move or symlink the corresponding .py module.
  - Ensure each new directory contains an __init__.py file that exposes key classes/functions (e.g., for OrderExecutor, export the OrderExecutor class).
- [ ] Update import paths in the affected modules if necessary.
- [ ] Re-run the verification script to confirm integration compatibility.
- [ ] Update documentation to reflect the new module structure.
- [ ] Create further follow-up work items for additional feature enhancements if required.

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Verification script runs without import errors.
- Documentation reflects the updated project structure.
- Follow-up work items are created for any additional changes needed.

# Common Issues & Solutions

This document outlines common issues encountered in the project and their solutions.

## API Integration Issues

### 1. Authentication Failures

**Symptoms:** 401 Unauthorized errors when connecting to Coinbase API

**Common Causes:**
- Incorrect API key or secret
- Wrong permission settings for API keys
- System time out of sync (for timestamp-based signatures)
- Using old Coinbase Pro API instead of Coinbase Advanced Trade API

**Solutions:**
- Verify API keys are correct and have appropriate permissions
- Ensure system time is synchronized
- Follow the authentication example in `docs/examples/authentication.py`
- Make sure you're using `coinbase-advanced-trade` library, not `coinbasepro`

### 2. WebSocket Connection Issues

**Symptoms:** WebSocket connection fails to establish or disconnects frequently

**Common Causes:**
- Incorrect WebSocket URL
- Authentication errors
- Network issues
- Incorrect message format

**Solutions:**
- Verify WebSocket URL is `wss://advanced-trade-ws.coinbase.com`
- Ensure authentication is properly implemented
- Add retry logic with exponential backoff
- Follow the WebSocket example in `docs/examples/websocket_example.py`

## Implementation Issues

### 1. Missing Methods

**Symptoms:** `AttributeError` during runtime indicating a missing method

**Common Causes:**
- Method implementation missing
- Method renamed but references not updated
- Dependencies not correctly established

**Solutions:**
- Check the component's required methods in the verification script
- Run the verification script before testing
- Check dependencies between components

### 2. Type Errors

**Symptoms:** TypeError or similar errors during runtime

**Common Causes:**
- Incorrect data types passed between components
- API responses not properly parsed
- Missing or incorrect type hints

**Solutions:**
- Add type hints to clarify expected types
- Add data validation for inputs
- Follow the type standards in `docs/standards/type_standards.md`

## Testing Issues

### 1. Test Failures

**Symptoms:** Tests fail during verification

**Common Causes:**
- Implementation doesn't match requirements
- Test expectations don't match actual behavior
- Tests are outdated
- Mock objects not properly configured

**Solutions:**
- Review implementation against requirements
- Update tests to match current expected behavior
- Ensure mock objects simulate actual API behavior

### 2. Coverage Issues

**Symptoms:** Test coverage below threshold

**Common Causes:**
- Missing test cases for error conditions
- Missing tests for edge cases
- New code without corresponding tests

**Solutions:**
- Add tests for error conditions
- Add tests for edge cases
- Follow the test-driven development approach

## Workflow Issues

### 1. Git Issues

**Symptoms:** Git conflicts, lost work, etc.

**Common Causes:**
- Multiple people working on the same file
- Not pulling latest changes before starting work
- Complex merges

**Solutions:**
- Coordinate work on related files
- Always pull before starting new work
- Use feature branches for isolation

### 2. Dependency Conflicts

**Symptoms:** Errors about incompatible dependencies

**Common Causes:**
- Using different versions of the same library
- Libraries with conflicting dependencies
- Missing dependencies

**Solutions:**
- Use a requirements.txt file to lock dependencies
- Use virtual environments to isolate project dependencies
- Document dependency changes

# Quality Control Process

This document outlines our mandatory quality control process for all changes to the codebase.

## 1. Pre-Implementation Verification

Before implementing any new feature or fix:

- [ ] Identify which component(s) will be affected (refer to project_structure.md)
- [ ] Document the specific change in a clear, concise manner
- [ ] Verify the change aligns with existing architecture
- [ ] Check for dependencies with other components

## 2. Implementation Checklist

When implementing changes:

- [ ] Follow the API standards in project_structure.md
- [ ] Document all public methods with docstrings
- [ ] Handle errors appropriately
- [ ] Ensure backward compatibility
- [ ] Add clear comments for complex logic

## 3. Testing Protocol

All changes must pass the following testing protocol:

### A. Unit Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for new functionality
- [ ] Verify tests cover success cases
- [ ] Verify tests cover error cases
- [ ] Run specific tests: `python -m pytest tests/path/to/specific_test.py -v`
- [ ] Ensure test coverage is maintained or improved

### B. Integration Testing
- [ ] Test interaction with other components
- [ ] Verify compatibility with existing functionality
- [ ] Run integration tests: `python -m pytest tests/integration/ -v`

### C. Manual Testing
- [ ] Test in paper trading mode if applicable
- [ ] Verify configuration handling
- [ ] Test with sample data

## 4. Code Review Process

All changes should undergo the following review:

1. Self-review:
   - [ ] Check implementation against design
   - [ ] Verify all tests pass
   - [ ] Check for common pitfalls (see common_issues.md)

2. AI Assistant review:
   - [ ] Request review with specific questions
   - [ ] Verify AI suggestions maintain architectural integrity
   - [ ] Don't accept changes without understanding them

## 5. Change Verification

After implementing changes:

- [ ] Run the verification script: `python scripts/verify_implementation.py --component=[component_name]`
- [ ] Fix any issues identified by the verification
- [ ] Document any deviations from the standard approach

## Change Acceptance Criteria

A change is considered complete and acceptable when:

1. It passes all tests in the testing protocol
2. Test coverage is at least 85% for the changed component
3. The verification script reports no issues
4. All checklist items are completed

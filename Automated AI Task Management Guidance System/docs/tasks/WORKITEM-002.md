# WORKITEM-002: Automated AI Task Management Guidance System

## Task Details

Component: Task Management

## Implementation Notes

The goal of this task is to create a comprehensive task management guidance system for the project. This system will help in managing tasks efficiently and ensure that best practices are followed throughout the project lifecycle.

Key areas to address:
- Implement scripts for starting and finishing tasks
- Create documentation for task management processes
- Set up a work tracking system to monitor task progress
- Ensure that the task management system integrates seamlessly with the existing project structure

## Testing Steps

1. Test the `start_task.py` script
   ```python
   python scripts/start_task.py 002 "Automated AI Task Management Guidance System"
   ```

2. Verify that the task document is created and the work tracking document is updated
   ```python
   cat docs/tasks/WORKITEM-002.md
   cat docs/work_tracking.md
   ```

3. Test the `finish_task.py` script
   ```python
   python scripts/finish_task.py 002 "Automated AI Task Management Guidance System"
   ```

4. Verify that the task document is updated with verification results and the work tracking document is marked as complete
   ```python
   cat docs/tasks/WORKITEM-002.md
   cat docs/work_tracking.md
   ```

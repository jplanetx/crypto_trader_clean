# GETTING STARTED

Welcome to the project! This guide will help you set up your environment and get started with development.

## Overview
This project employs a threaded workflow to manage development tasks effectively.

## Thread Management System
- **Completing a Thread:**  
  Use the command:
  ```
  python scripts/thread_manager.py --complete <THREAD_ID>
  ```
- **Starting a New Thread:**  
  Use the command:
  ```
  python scripts/thread_manager.py --init <THREAD_ID>
  ```

### Starting Continuation Threads
If ongoing work is identified from a completed thread, continue the work as a new thread. For example, for additional work from THREAD_005, initialize it as THREAD_005_A:
1. Mark the previous thread as complete:
   ```
   python scripts/thread_manager.py --complete THREAD_005
   ```
2. Start the new continuation thread:
   ```
   python scripts/thread_manager.py --init THREAD_005_A
   ```

Ensure that you follow all verification procedures detailed in the thread configurations.

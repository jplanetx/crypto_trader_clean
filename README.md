# Project README

## Overview
This project is organized to support modular development with an integrated thread management system that streamlines our workflow.

## Thread Management System
The thread management system enables developers to manage tasks in structured threads:

- **Archiving a Thread:**  
  To mark a thread as complete, execute:
  ```
  python scripts/thread_manager.py --complete <THREAD_ID>
  ```

- **Starting a New Thread:**  
  To initialize a new thread, execute:
  ```
  python scripts/thread_manager.py --init <THREAD_ID>
  ```

### Continuation Threads
For work that extends an existing thread, continue with a new thread identifier. For example, additional work from `THREAD_005` is continued as `THREAD_005_A`:
- Complete the original thread:
  ```
  python scripts/thread_manager.py --complete THREAD_005
  ```
- Initialize the continuation thread:
  ```
  python scripts/thread_manager.py --init THREAD_005_A
  ```

## Documentation
- **THREAD_START_GUIDE.md:** Contains detailed instructions on thread management.
- **GETTING_STARTED.md:** Provides guidance on project setup, including thread management commands and verification procedures.

## Development Workflow
Before integrating changes, run the verification scripts to ensure all tests and checks pass:
```
python scripts/verify_thread.py --check-all
python scripts/verify_thread.py --check-coverage
python scripts/verify_thread.py --cleanup
```

## Additional Notes
Keep the configuration and documentation files updated as the project evolves. Ensure that any updates in thread management, dependency versions, or verification procedures are reflected promptly in the documentation.

Happy coding!

# Next Thread Instructions (for THREAD_005)

This thread focuses on system enhancement and refactoring. Key tasks include:

- **Emergency Manager Refactoring:**  
  Refactor `src/core/emergency_manager.py` to fix backup file handling and improve recovery reliability.

- **Configuration Management Enhancement:**  
  Enhance configuration validation and versioning by updating `src/core/config_validator.py` and related configuration files (e.g., `config/config_schema.json`).

- **Code Quality Improvements:**  
  Refactor code to reduce complexity, remove duplicate code, and implement centralized exception handling and improved logging.

- **Threading Optimizations:**  
  Optimize threading and concurrency within the project for better performance and resource usage.

## Verification Steps
- Run the following commands to verify the setup:
  - **All Checks:**  
    `python scripts/verify_thread.py --check-all`
  - **Cleanup:**  
    `python scripts/verify_thread.py --cleanup`
- Update the active thread JSON file (`thread_management/active_thread/005.json`) manually to mark the completion of each checklist item as verification tests pass.

## Future Thread Continuity
When THREAD_005 is complete, use the following process to prepare for the next thread:
1. Use the provided template to create a new thread configuration (e.g., copy `thread_management/templates/thread_005_init.json` and update the `"thread_id"` to the next available ID such as `"006"` or `"005_A"` if continuing specific work).
2. Execute:
   ```
   python scripts/thread_manager.py --init <NEW_THREAD_ID>
   ```
   to initialize the new thread.
3. Optionally, run a custom command (e.g., `python scripts/update_next_thread_template.py --next`) to update this file automatically with appropriate context for the upcoming thread.

This document should be updated as part of your continuous workflow, ensuring that each new thread is initialized with clear instructions and context from previous work.
